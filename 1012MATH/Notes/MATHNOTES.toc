\contentsline {paragraph}{A system of linear equations is literally a set of linear lines. The number of total terms correspond to the number of dimensions. For example:}{2}{}%
\contentsline {paragraph}{The above corresponds to a 3 dimensional space with 3 planes (2d would be a line) where $a\to i$ and $n_{1\to 3}$ correspond to constants and x,y,z correspond to the 3 units for space}{2}{}%
